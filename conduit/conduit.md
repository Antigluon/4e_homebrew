## Sorcerer (Conduit) Class Features

### Eidolon

You have bound an eidolon, a creature of arcane power that you can summon an incarnation of to your side.  
The eidolon is a stalwart protector that can take on many forms, but all of them share a roiling,
esoteric power channelled through you and made manifest by your will.  
You gain the Summon Eidolon power.

**Summon Eidolon** | **Sorcerer Feature**  
**At-Will** <> **Arcane**, **Implement**, **Summoning**, **Varies**  
**Minor Action** | **Ranged** 10  
**Effect**: You summon a Medium eidolon in an unoccupied square within range.  
Choose an eidolon form you know: the eidolon's speeds, traits, and special commands are determined by the form you choose.
You can use any arcane power you know without the Summoning keyword through the eidolon,
as though it were one of the eidolon's special commands and referred to the eidolon rather than you;
the power is still expended normally.  
**Special**: You can only have one eidolon summoned at a time. If you try to use this power when you already have an eidolon summoned, the power fails.  
When you summon your eidolon after dismissing it this encounter, it returns with the amount of hit points it had when dismissed unless you spend a healing surge to restore it to full hit points.
_(An eidolon destroyed by being reduced to 0 hit points or lower doesn't cost an extra healing surge to re-summon.)_
Conditions and other effects don't carry over, as usual; treat the new eidolon as a new creature in all ways except for its starting hit points.

#### Sidebar: "Through the eidolon?"

this is kind of ugly but basically I want you to be able to
Sudden Scales/Fog Form/Spark Form/Flame Spiral\*
through your eidolon and have that work as expected -
i.e. your eidolon gets the defensive buff/shift from spark form/adjacency effect for flame spiral.  
I'm not sure if how I've written it is the best way to do this though, or whether it actually works.

\*Flame spiral being messed up and evil aside, anyway.

### Synchronicity

When you take a move action to move, you can, as a free action, command a creature you have summoned to take one of the following actions:
crawl, escape, run, stand up, shift, squeeze, or walk.
